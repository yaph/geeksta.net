        <h1>How Limiting My Internet Usage Changed the Way I Work and Live</h1>
        <p>After canceling my DSL subscription, I decided to rely solely on mobile data for my Internet access at home. To make things even more intentional, I chose a data plan capped at 30GB per month. For someone who works from home as a system administrator and programmer, this monthly limit might sound restrictive — especially when you factor in the need to update software and keep a reliable connection for work.</p>
<p>But after over a month of living with this setup, I've found that the experience has noticeably changed my habits and workflow for the better. While it hasn't always been easy, it has caused me to reexamine how I use the Internet and how I approach my work and daily tasks. Here's what I've learned.</p>
<h2 id="deliberate-internet-usage">Deliberate Internet Usage</h2>
<p>With a limited data plan, I've had to think critically about when and how to use the Internet. In the past, I might have spent long stretches mindlessly browsing or keeping tabs open "just in case." Now, my online sessions are deliberate and focused on specific needs to avoid unnecessary data consumption.</p>
<p>This shift in mindset has been unexpectedly liberating. It feels good to be mindful about Internet usage instead of passively being led by it.</p>
<h2 id="reduced-social-media-and-procrastination">Reduced Social Media and Procrastination</h2>
<p>One of the most notable changes in my daily life has been my reduced reliance on social media. Previously, I could easily get lost scrolling through feeds multiple times a day. With a 30GB limit, I've had to be stricter about that behavior, and this change has naturally curtailed procrastination.</p>
<p>The result? I now spend more time on meaningful activities and less time falling into the black hole of endless content. It's refreshing to have that clarity.</p>
<h2 id="once-a-day-routine-check-ins">Once-a-Day Routine Check-Ins</h2>
<p>Like many others, I regularly visit certain websites for both personal and work-related reasons, such as dashboards with statistics, analytics, or updates on business matters. In the past, I would check these sites several times a day — largely out of habit.</p>
<p>With my Internet usage now restricted, I've instituted a once-a-day routine for checking most of these sites. I haven't felt like I was missing anything important. This approach has reduced interruptions, minimized distractions, and given me more time to focus on single tasks at hand.</p>
<h2 id="problem-solving-with-my-own-brain">Problem-Solving with My Own Brain</h2>
<p>As a programmer and tech worker, it's natural to rely on tools like search engines, forums, or large language models (LLMs) to quickly troubleshoot problems. However, with more constrained access to the Internet, I've started depending less on these tools and more on my own problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>For example, I turned off features like GitHub Copilot in my development environment because of how often I worked offline. This change has pushed me to reason through issues independently before seeking an external solution. Not only has this improved my productivity, but it's also reinforced confidence in my existing knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="a-life-with-fewer-distractions">A Life with Fewer Distractions</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of this experiment has been the calmness I've felt in my daily routine. Without constant connectivity, there's simply less noise.</p>
<p>This reduced connectivity has helped me focus better on what matters and let go of things beyond my control. It's a small step, but it's had an outsized impact on my overall sense of well-being.</p>
<h2 id="reflections-on-the-experiment">Reflections on the Experiment</h2>
<p>Certainly, this lifestyle adjustment comes with its own challenges. For example, I've had to plan ahead for downloading essential updates and think twice about how I use my allotted data. However, these minor inconveniences have been outweighed by the benefits of living with a more intentional and efficient approach to the Internet.</p>
<p>This experience has given me a new perspective: Having constant, unlimited Internet access isn't universally beneficial, especially if it fosters habits that detract from what you truly want to accomplish. Setting limits, whether self-imposed or due to a data cap, can help reset your relationship with technology in a constructive way.</p>
<p>Will I stick with this 30GB limit for the long run? I'm not sure yet. But the lessons I've learned — about being conscious of my habits, staying focused, and reducing distractions — will remain with me regardless of my future Internet plans. For now, I'm enjoying life with less digital noise.</p>
