        <p>When developing Python programs, it’s crucial to exit gracefully — whether your program ends by design or due to unexpected interruptions. Graceful exits ensure that resources are released, cleanup tasks are completed, and users receive clear feedback.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explore the most common ways to exit a Python program cleanly with practical examples and best practices.</p>
<h2 id="1-using-sysexit">1. Using <code>sys.exit()</code></h2>
<p>The most reliable, built-in way to terminate a Python program in scripts or production environments is <code>sys.exit()</code> from the <code>sys</code> module. It allows you to stop program execution immediately and optionally send a message or return an exit code for external tools or systems.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def main():
    print(&quot;This is the main part of the program.&quot;)
    # Perform your program tasks here
    print(&quot;Now quitting the program.&quot;)

    # Exit with a message
    sys.exit(&quot;Goodbye! The program is now exiting.&quot;)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>sys.exit()</code> function stops the entire program.</li>
<li>If provided, the argument (e.g., <code>"Goodbye!"</code>) is displayed to the console, or passed to the parent process when used in automation pipelines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use an integer (0 for success, non-zero for errors) if your program is part of a pipeline or being managed/testing by external tools, such as shell scripts or CI/CD systems.</p>
<h2 id="2-handling-keyboard-interrupts-ctrlc">2. Handling Keyboard Interrupts (<code>Ctrl+C</code>)</h2>
<p>When users terminate your program by pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code>, Python raises a <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exception. It’s a good practice to handle this exception explicitly, ensuring the program exits cleanly and provides feedback.</p>
<h3 id="example_1">Example:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def main():
    try:
        print(&quot;Program is running. Press Ctrl+C to exit.&quot;)
        # Simulate a long-running task
        while True:
            pass  # Replace with actual logic
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print(&quot;KeyboardInterrupt detected. Cleaning up and exiting...&quot;)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit gracefully with exit status 0

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why Handle <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to catch <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> might leave critical cleanup tasks incomplete (e.g., closing files, shutting down threads, or releasing database locks).</li>
<li>Adding a friendly exit message improves the user experience for interactive programs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Replace infinite loops with specific long-running tasks in production for better program reliability.</p>
<h2 id="3-understanding-the-sysexit-function-signature">3. Understanding the <code>sys.exit()</code> Function Signature</h2>
<p>The signature for <code>sys.exit()</code> provides flexibility in how you terminate your program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sys.exit([arg])
</code></pre>
<h3 id="key-points">Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>arg</code></strong>: This optional parameter controls the exit behavior:</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integer (recommended):</strong> <code>0</code> indicates successful termination, while non-zero integers (e.g., <code>1</code>) indicate an error or abnormal termination.</p>
<p><code>python
sys.exit(1)  # Signals an error occurred</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>String:</strong> If a string or other object is passed, it will be printed to <code>stderr</code>, and an exit status of <code>1</code> is returned.</p>
<p><code>python
sys.exit("An error occurred.")</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>None:</strong> Defaults to <code>0</code> (successful termination).</p>
<p><code>python
sys.exit()  # Same as sys.exit(0)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use numeric exit codes with external-facing applications, especially if they interact with other services or scripts. Reserve strings for user-facing messages.</p>
<h2 id="4-why-avoid-using-quit-and-exit-in-scripts">4. Why Avoid Using <code>quit()</code> and <code>exit()</code> in Scripts?</h2>
<p>Python provides two additional commands, <code>quit()</code> and <code>exit()</code>, for exiting programs, but these are intended for use in interactive environments like the Python REPL.</p>
<h3 id="example-interactive-mode-only">Example (Interactive Mode Only):</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why Not Use Them in Programs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Designed for REPL:</strong> <code>quit()</code> and <code>exit()</code> are part of the <code>site</code> module, not the Python core. They don’t work well in all environments, especially when running scripts or within larger systems.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistencies:</strong> In non-interactive environments (e.g., automation scripts or server applications), they often fail to terminate programs reliably.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Always use <code>sys.exit()</code> in scripts and production code. Reserve <code>quit()</code> and <code>exit()</code> for ad-hoc testing or experimenting in the REPL.</p>
<h2 id="5-avoiding-abrupt-exits-with-os_exit">5. Avoiding Abrupt Exits with <code>os._exit()</code></h2>
<p>The <code>os._exit()</code> function exists for extreme cases where you need to terminate a program immediately — bypassing normal cleanup processes like flushing I/O buffers or garbage collection. This is rarely advisable.</p>
<h3 id="example_2">Example:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os

os._exit(1)  # Use only in rare circumstances
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When to Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved for advanced scenarios such as terminating worker processes in multithreaded systems.</li>
<li>Avoid in most cases, as it skips important teardown steps, potentially leaving resources in an unstable state.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Stick to <code>sys.exit()</code> unless you absolutely need the low-level control provided by <code>os._exit()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="6-final-tips-for-exiting-gracefully">6. Final Tips for Exiting Gracefully</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release Resources:</strong> Always ensure files, sockets, or database connections are properly closed before exiting. Use context managers wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python
  with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
      data = file.read()
  # File automatically closed on exit</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide Feedback:</strong> Show meaningful messages when exiting due to errors or user actions.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Silent Failures:</strong> Use logging or clear <code>sys.exit()</code> exit codes when terminating during errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Graceful program termination is a small but essential aspect of Python programming. By using <code>sys.exit()</code> where appropriate, handling <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exceptions, and avoiding improper approaches like <code>quit()</code> or <code>os._exit()</code> in production code, you can ensure clean and predictable program exits.</p>
<p>With these best practices, you’ll not only improve your code’s reliability but also enhance the user experience for anyone running your Python programs.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>When developing a standalone Python application, properly structuring your code and managing imports is key to ensuring your program works consistently—whether you're testing it locally or distributing it with tools like <code>pipx</code>. In this post, we'll walk through how to design your project, handle imports effectively, and prepare your app for installation.</p>
<h2 id="why-proper-imports-and-project-structure-matter">Why Proper Imports and Project Structure Matter</h2>
<p>In Python, how your project is structured significantly impacts module discovery and usability. Mismanaging imports can lead to frustrating <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code> issues, especially when transitioning between development and production. A clean structure makes your code easier to maintain, test, and distribute.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>Let's start by establishing a clear project layout. For this example, suppose you're creating an application called <code>myapp</code>. Here's our example directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>myapp/
  mymodule/
    __init__.py
    util.py
    cli.py
  setup.py
</code></pre>
<h3 id="key-elements">Key Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>mymodule/</code></strong>: This is the main package containing your application's logic.</li>
<li><strong><code>__init__.py</code></strong>: Marks the directory as a Python package. Even though Python 3.3+ doesn't require it, adding this file is a good practice, especially for compatibility and clarity.</li>
<li><strong><code>setup.py</code></strong>: Defines the metadata and entry points for your application, enabling installation and usage as a standalone command.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="absolute-vs-relative-imports">Absolute vs. Relative Imports</h2>
<p>When writing modular code, you'll frequently need to import one part of your application into another. Python supports both <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> imports. Here, we recommend using <strong>absolute imports</strong>, as they are more explicit and easier to understand.</p>
<h3 id="example-using-an-absolute-import-in-clipy">Example: Using an Absolute Import in <code>cli.py</code></h3>
<p>Suppose <code>cli.py</code> needs to use a function from <code>util.py</code>. Here's how you would handle the import:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># mymodule/cli.py
from mymodule import util

def main():
    # Your application's entry point
    print(util.some_function())
</code></pre>
<p>This approach directly specifies where <code>util</code> resides within the overall package structure, reducing ambiguity.</p>
<h2 id="running-your-script-locally">Running Your Script Locally</h2>
<p>To ensure your script runs correctly during development, always execute it with the <code>-m</code> flag from the root directory of your project. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd myapp
python -m mymodule.cli
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag tells Python to treat <code>mymodule.cli</code> as a module in the package context, making imports like <code>from mymodule import util</code> work seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="important-avoid-running-modules-directly">Important: Avoid Running Modules Directly</h3>
<p>Running files directly (e.g., <code>python mymodule/cli.py</code>) can lead to import errors because Python won't treat <code>mymodule</code> as part of a package. Always use the <code>-m</code> approach for package-based scripts.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-installation-with-pipx">Preparing for Installation with pipx</h2>
<p>Distributing your application as a standalone tool is simple with pipx. First, you need to create a <code>setup.py</code> file to define your package and its entry point.</p>
<h3 id="example-setuppy">Example: <code>setup.py</code></h3>
<p>Here's a minimal <code>setup.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='myapp',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'myapp=mymodule.cli:main',
        ],
    },
)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whats-happening-here">What's Happening Here?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>find_packages()</code></strong>: Automatically detects all your Python packages, including sub-packages like <code>mymodule</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>entry_points</code></strong>: Defines a command-line executable (<code>myapp</code>) that maps to the <code>main()</code> function in <code>mymodule.cli</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-the-entry-point">Configuring the Entry Point</h2>
<p>Your CLI script (<code>cli.py</code>) needs a <code>main()</code> function to be callable from the command line. Here's how it should look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># mymodule/cli.py
from mymodule import util

def main():
    # Your application logic goes here
    print(util.some_function())

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>main()</code> function is included in the <code>setup.py</code> file as the starting point of your application.</p>
<h2 id="testing-and-installing-with-pipx">Testing and Installing with pipx</h2>
<p>Once your project is ready, you can use pipx to install and test it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the root of your project directory:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd myapp
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Install the application with pipx:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pipx install .
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Run your application from anywhere using the executable name defined in your <code>setup.py</code> (<code>myapp</code> in this case):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">myapp
</code></pre>
<p>By relying on pipx, your app will work in an isolated environment, reducing the need to manage Python dependencies globally.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Managing imports and structuring your project correctly paves the way for both smooth development and seamless distribution. Using <strong>absolute imports</strong> helps maintain clarity and consistency across your codebase, while tools like pipx make installing and running standalone applications a breeze.</p>
<p>By following the steps outlined here, you'll be well-equipped to create polished, professional Python applications that are easy to share and use. If you plan to publish your app to PyPI, consider adding a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file for simplified dependency and build management. Happy coding! 🐍</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>User registration spam can be a significant nuisance for WordPress site administrators, leading to bloated databases, potential security risks, and unnecessary clutter. Fortunately, Fail2ban, a powerful intrusion prevention software, can help mitigate this issue by monitoring log files and banning IP addresses exhibiting suspicious behavior. In this guide, we'll walk you through configuring Fail2ban to prevent user registration spam on your WordPress site using Apache logs.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-guide-to-configure-fail2ban">Step-by-Step Guide to Configure Fail2ban</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-ensure-fail2ban-is-installed">Step 1: Ensure Fail2ban is Installed</h3>
<p>First, you need to have Fail2ban installed on your server. If it's not already installed, you can install it using your package manager. For Debian-based systems, the following commands will do the trick:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-2-create-a-custom-filter-for-detecting-registration-attempts">Step 2: Create a Custom Filter for Detecting Registration Attempts</h3>
<p>Next, create a custom filter file for Fail2ban to detect user registration attempts. This filter will parse the Apache logs to find registration attempts and take action based on your configuration.</p>
<p>Create a new filter file named <code>wordpress-registration.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wordpress-registration.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following content to this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">[Definition]
failregex = ^&lt;HOST&gt; - - \[.*\] &quot;POST /wp-login\.php\?action=register HTTP/.*&quot; 302
ignoreregex =
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>failregex</code> is designed to match log entries corresponding to user registration attempts in your Apache logs. <code>ignoreregex</code> is left empty because we don't want to ignore any relevant behavior.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-configure-a-fail2ban-jail-for-wordpress-registrations">Step 3: Configure a Fail2ban Jail for WordPress Registrations</h3>
<p>Now, create a new jail configuration file named <code>wordpress-registration.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/wordpress-registration.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Add the following content to this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">[wordpress-registration]
enabled = true
filter = wordpress-registration
logpath = /var/log/apache2/access.log
maxretry = 1
findtime = 600
bantime = 86400
</code></pre>
<p>In this configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>logpath</code> points to your Apache access log file. Adjust this path if your log file is located elsewhere.</li>
<li><code>maxretry = 1</code> means that after one registration attempt from the same IP, the IP will be banned.</li>
<li><code>findtime = 600</code> (in seconds) is the window during which the attempts are counted.</li>
<li><code>bantime = 86400</code> (in seconds) is the duration for which the IP will be banned (24 hours).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-restart-fail2ban">Step 4: Restart Fail2ban</h3>
<p>To apply your new configuration, restart the Fail2ban service:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-5-verify-the-setup">Step 5: Verify the Setup</h3>
<p>Finally, ensure that your new filter is working correctly by tailing the Fail2ban log:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
</code></pre>
<p>Monitor the log for any entries related to the <code>wordpress-registration</code> jail. You should see Fail2ban detecting and banning IPs as expected when they attempt to register users on your WordPress site.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By configuring Fail2ban to monitor your Apache logs, you can effectively prevent user registration spam on your WordPress site. This setup helps maintain the integrity and performance of your website by blocking spammers and ensuring only legitimate users can register. Regularly check your logs and adjust the configuration as necessary to fine-tune the protection based on your site's needs.</p>
<p>With Fail2ban in place, you can focus more on building and managing your WordPress site without worrying about the constant influx of spam registrations.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Working with text files is a fundamental part of many tasks in fields like data analysis, software development, and system administration. One common task is comparing two files to identify lines that are unique to one of them. For Unix/Linux users, the <code>grep</code> command is a powerful tool that can simplify this process significantly. In this post, we'll explore how to use <code>grep</code> to find lines in file A that do not appear in file B.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-grep">Why Use <code>grep</code>?</h2>
<p>While there are several ways to compare files (like using <code>diff</code> or <code>comm</code>), <code>grep</code> offers a flexible and straightforward approach, especially if you're already familiar with using it for text searching. With a few options, <code>grep</code> can serve as an effective tool for file comparison.</p>
<h2 id="the-command">The Command</h2>
<p>To locate lines in file A that are not present in file B, you can use the following <code>grep</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep -Fxv -f B A
</code></pre>
<h3 id="breaking-down-the-command">Breaking Down the Command</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>-F</code></strong>: This option tells <code>grep</code> to interpret the pattern as a fixed string, not a regular expression. This is important when you have special characters that you want to treat literally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>-x</code></strong>: The <code>-x</code> flag ensures the match is for the whole line, meaning the entire line in file A must match the entire line in file B for it to be considered the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>-v</code></strong>: This option inverts the match. Normally, <code>grep</code> would show you the lines that do match, but with <code>-v</code>, it will show only the lines that do not match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>-f B</code></strong>: This option allows you to specify a file (<code>B</code> in this case) from which <code>grep</code> can read patterns. These patterns are the lines you want to exclude from the results when searching in file A.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practical-example">Practical Example</h2>
<p>Imagine you have two lists: <code>employees.txt</code> with the names of all employees in a company, and <code>attended_workshop.txt</code> with the names of those who attended a particular workshop. To find out who didn't attend, you can apply the above <code>grep</code> command and get the desired list in seconds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep -Fxv -f attended_workshop.txt employees.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using <code>grep</code> for file comparison like this can save you time and effort, especially when you're working with large files. It's just another demonstration of how versatile <code>grep</code> is beyond its primary use case of searching text. Whether you're cleaning data, analyzing logs, or just tidying up files, <code>grep</code> remains a go-to tool in the Unix/Linux arsenal.</p>

        <link><![CDATA[https://geeksta.net/geeklog/open-applications-in-fullscreen-on-ubuntu/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to make Ubuntu applications launch in fullscreen by modifying desktop files and application settings with this short step-by-step guide.</p>]]></description>
        <guid><![CDATA[https://geeksta.net/geeklog/open-applications-in-fullscreen-on-ubuntu/]]></guid>
        <pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 21:36:52 </pubDate>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>One of my pet peeves with Ubuntu Linux is that several of the applications I'm using are not opened in fullscreen, even if I maximized them in the previous session. Not sure if that's a bug or a feature, but it is not the behavior I want.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to ensure applications open in fullscreen mode. Some have a corresponding setting, others have a command-line flag, and some applications offer neither of these options.</p>
<p>For applications that have a command-line flag, you can modify the corresponding <code>.desktop</code> file to open them in fullscreen.</p>
<h2 id="using-desktop-files">Using Desktop Files</h2>
<p>Desktop files (<code>.desktop</code> files) are configuration files that define how applications appear in your system's menu and how they behave when launched. Located typically in <code>/usr/share/applications/</code>, these files can be customized on a per-user basis by creating copies in <code>~/.local/share/applications/</code>.</p>
<p>Let's walk through the process using Evince as an example:</p>
<p><strong>1. Check the online help to see whether there is an option:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">evince --help
...
-f, --fullscreen            Run evince in fullscreen mode
...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Create a local copy of the Evince desktop file:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
cp /usr/share/applications/org.gnome.Evince.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Edit the local copy and modify the <code>Exec=</code> line to include the <code>--fullscreen</code> option:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim ~/.local/share/applications/org.gnome.Evince.desktop
...
Exec=evince --fullscreen %U
...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>4. Update the desktop database:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
</code></pre>
<p>Now, Evince will launch in fullscreen mode by default when you open a PDF or other supported documents.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While this method works fine for Evince, it's not a universal solution. Some applications require different approaches:</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>For VS Code, the desktop file modification approach doesn't work. Instead, you'll need to adjust the application's settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open VS Code</li>
<li>Go to Settings (Ctrl+,)</li>
<li>Search for <code>window.titleBarStyle</code></li>
<li>Set the value to <code>custom</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This setting ensures that VS Code windows open maximized across all new windows.</p>
<h3 id="keepassx">KeePassX</h3>
<p>Similarly, KeePassX lacks a command-line option to start in fullscreen and has no corresponding setting that I'm aware of either. For these cases, I use the keyboard shortcut <code>Super (Windows or Command key) + Up Arrow</code> or double-click the title bar to manually maximize the window.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always create a local copy of the desktop file before modifying.</li>
<li>Preserve the original file's structure, the local file must be a complete, standalone desktop file.</li>
<li>Run the <code>update-desktop-database</code> command to ensure changes take effect.</li>
<li>Remember that not all applications support fullscreen launch via desktop files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Modifying desktop files offers a flexible way to customize application launch behaviors. While not a one-size-fits-all solution, it provides a powerful technique for personalizing your Linux desktop experience.</p>
<p>Next time you find an application launching in a less-than-ideal window size, remember: a simple desktop file modification might be the solution you're looking for!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>When managing remote Linux servers, you might need to run scripts that take hours, even after you've disconnected, for example a system backup or scan. This is where the <code>screen</code> utility shines, allowing processes to continue running independently of your SSH session. Below is a brief step-by-step guide on using <code>screen</code> to manage long-running tasks efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-screen">Getting Started with <code>screen</code></h2>
<h3 id="step-1-connect-to-the-remote-server">Step 1: Connect to the Remote Server</h3>
<p>Use SSH to log into your server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh user@remote-server
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-2-start-a-screen-session">Step 2: Start a Screen Session</h3>
<p>Initiate a new screen session and give it a name for easy identification later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">screen -S my_backup_session
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-3-execute-your-script">Step 3: Execute Your Script</h3>
<p>Run your backup or long-term script within the screen session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./backup_script.sh
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-4-detach-the-screen-session">Step 4: Detach the Screen Session</h3>
<p>Once your script is running, detach the session without interrupting the process:</p>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + a</code>, then <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>This keystroke leaves the session intact, running in the background.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-disconnect-from-the-server">Step 5: Disconnect from the Server</h3>
<p>You can now safely log out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">exit
</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-reattach-to-check-progress">Step 6: Reattach to Check Progress</h3>
<p>When you wish to check on the script:</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH back into the server:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   ssh user@remote-server</code></p>
<ol>
<li>List active screen sessions:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   screen -ls</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Reattach to your specific session:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   screen -r my_backup_session</code></p>
<h3 id="step-7-end-the-session">Step 7: End the Session</h3>
<p>When your task completes, exit the screen session by closing the shell:</p>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + d</code>.</p>
<p>This will terminate the session once your script has concluded.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Utilizing <code>screen</code> not only secures your long-running scripts from unexpected SSH disconnections but also offers the flexibility to monitor progress and manage multiple tasks simultaneously. It's an essential tool for any Linux server administrator seeking reliability and efficiency.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to troubleshoot and resolve issues with your external hard drive on Linux. Follow these steps to diagnose problems, check connections, and recover data.</p><img src="/img/geeklog/external-hard-drive.webp" alt="Preview Image">]]></description>
        <guid><![CDATA[https://geeksta.net/geeklog/troubleshooting-external-hard-drives-on-linux/]]></guid>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 13:18:59 </pubDate>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>External hard drives are essential for many users, providing extra storage, backup capabilities, and portability. However, encountering issues where the drive is no longer recognized by your Linux-based operating system can be frustrating. I recently faced this issue and compiled the information I researched into this guide. I hope it helps you troubleshoot and resolve common problems to regain access to your data.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-check-physical-connections">Step 1: Check Physical Connections</h2>
<p>Before diving into software troubleshooting, ensure that all physical connections are secure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the hard drive and plug it back in securely.</li>
<li>Use a different USB port on your computer.</li>
<li>If possible, use a different USB cable.</li>
<li>Connect the hard drive to another computer to see if it is recognized.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-2-check-power-supply">Step 2: Check Power Supply</h2>
<ol>
<li>If the hard drive has an external power supply, ensure it is properly connected and working.</li>
<li>Make sure the USB port provides enough power, especially for larger drives. Using a powered USB hub might help.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-3-check-system-messages">Step 3: Check System Messages</h2>
<p>After reconnecting the drive, open a terminal and check the <code>dmesg</code> output for any relevant messages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo dmesg | grep -i usb
</code></pre>
<p>Look for error messages like <code>device descriptor read error</code> or <code>unable to enumerate USB device</code>, which indicate problems with the USB connection.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-list-usb-devices">Step 4: List USB Devices</h2>
<p>Use <code>lsusb</code> to list all USB devices connected to your system and check if your external hard drive appears in the list. If it does, it means the drive is recognized at some level but may still have issues.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-disable-usb-autosuspend">Step 5: Disable USB Autosuspend</h2>
<p>Sometimes, USB autosuspend can cause issues. Disable it by editing the GRUB configuration:</p>
<p>Open and edit the GRUB configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo vim /etc/default/grub
</code></pre>
<p>Add <code>usbcore.autosuspend=-1</code> to the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> line. It should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;quiet splash usbcore.autosuspend=-1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Update GRUB and reboot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<p>Then check the <code>autosuspend</code> value, it should be <code>-1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend
</code></pre>
<p>If this doesn't help, I suggest undoing the changes.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-use-a-live-usb">Step 6: Use a Live USB</h2>
<p>Create a live USB stick with a different Linux distribution and boot from it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> or <a href="https://unetbootin.github.io/">UNetbootin</a> to create a live USB stick.</li>
<li>Boot your computer from the live USB stick.</li>
<li>After booting, connect your external hard drive and see if it is recognized.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-7-check-disk-health">Step 7: Check Disk Health</h2>
<p>If the drive is making unusual noises, it might indicate hardware failure. In this case, stop using the drive immediately to prevent further damage. If the data is critical, consider professional data recovery services.</p>
<h2 id="step-8-attempt-data-recovery">Step 8: Attempt Data Recovery</h2>
<p>If the drive is recognized but you can't access the data, use tools like TestDisk and PhotoRec:</p>
<p>Install TestDisk and PhotoRec:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install testdisk
</code></pre>
<p>Run TestDisk:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo testdisk
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the prompts to analyze and recover partitions or files.</p>
<h2 id="opening-the-case">Opening the Case</h2>
<p>If none of the above steps helped and the warranty on your hard drive is still valid, contact the seller or manufacturer for assistance. If the warranty has expired and you decide to open the hard drive case, here are some tips:</p>
<h3 id="what-to-look-out-for">What to Look Out For:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tamper-Evident Seal</strong>: You may notice a tamper-evident seal on the screws. These seals are typically made of materials like paper, plastic, vinyl, or foil. They are designed to show if the drive has been opened.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Damage</strong>: Look for visible signs of physical damage such as burned components, disconnected parts, or corrosion.</li>
<li><strong>Connections and Cables</strong>: Ensure that all internal connections and cables are intact and securely connected.</li>
<li><strong>PCB Inspection</strong>: Examine the printed circuit board (PCB) for any signs of damage or burnt areas.</li>
<li><strong>Heads and Platters</strong>: Avoid touching the platters or the read/write heads, as they are extremely sensitive and can be damaged easily.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="handling-and-safety-tips">Handling and Safety Tips:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Handle these materials minimally and wash your hands afterward.</li>
<li>Avoid ingesting any part of the seal. Seek medical advice if accidentally ingested.</li>
<li>Avoid inhaling any dust or particles if the seal is damaged.</li>
<li>If you have sensitive skin, wear gloves when handling to avoid potential irritation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially resolve issues with your external hard drive on Linux. If the drive continues to malfunction, especially if it makes unusual noises, consider consulting professional data recovery services to avoid permanent data loss. Regular backups and careful handling of external drives can prevent many common issues.</p>
<p>Keep your data safe and ensure your drives are functioning correctly to avoid any unnecessary headaches in the future.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>If you've ever experienced your SSH connection freezing due to inactivity, you're not alone. This common issue can be particularly frustrating, but fortunately, there's a simple solution. By adjusting your SSH client configuration, you can keep the connection alive. Follow these steps to prevent SSH timeout on your Linux machine.</p>
<h2 id="edit-the-ssh-configuration">Edit the SSH Configuration</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to edit the SSH configuration file. If it doesn't already exist, create it. Start a terminal and open the file with your preferred editor, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim ~/.ssh/config
</code></pre>
<p>Next, add the following lines to ensure your SSH connection remains active:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
</code></pre>
<p>Save the file and exit the text editor. For the changes to take effect, you need to restart your SSH connection.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>Here's what these settings do:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ServerAliveInterval 60</code>: This sends a keep-alive packet to the server every 60 seconds.</li>
<li><code>ServerAliveCountMax 3</code>: If the server does not respond after three keep-alive packets, the connection will be terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Your SSH connection should now remain active even during periods of inactivity. Adjust the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> value as needed to fit your specific requirements.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By following this short and simple guide, you can prevent your SSH connections from freezing due to inactivity. This small configuration change can save you from the hassle of repeatedly reconnecting to your remote servers.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Launching a merchandise business using print-on-demand services is an exciting venture with plenty of creative freedom and low startup costs. If you're new to this, one of the first steps is deciding on themes for your designs. Choosing popular and trending themes can significantly boost your sales, but it's crucial to be mindful of copyright laws. Let's dive into some of the most popular design themes and tips to get you started on the right foot.</p>
<h2 id="popular-design-themes">Popular Design Themes</h2>
<h3 id="pop-culture-references">Pop Culture References</h3>
<p>Pop culture is a goldmine for merchandise designs. References from movies, TV shows, and music can instantly attract fans. However, it's essential to note that using images or quotes from copyrighted material requires permission from the copyright owner. Without this, you could face legal issues. If you secure the necessary licenses, you can capitalize on the massive fan bases these references bring.</p>
<h3 id="funny-and-witty-sayings">Funny and Witty Sayings</h3>
<p>Humor never goes out of style. Designs featuring clever puns, jokes, and sarcastic quotes are always in demand. Since these are original creations, you won't have to worry about copyright issues, as long as you create your own content or ensure any quotes you use are in the public domain. Use tools like social media to gauge what types of humor resonate most with your target audience.</p>
<h3 id="sports-and-fitness">Sports and Fitness</h3>
<p>Designs that celebrate sports teams, players, and fitness inspiration can be very popular. Again, be careful with trademarks and logos.

<h3 id="social-causes-and-awareness">Social Causes and Awareness</h3>
<p>Designs promoting environmental sustainability, mental health awareness, and social justice can resonate with a broad audience. Creating original designs that support a cause can also help build a brand that customers feel good about supporting. Consider donating a portion of your profits to relevant charities to further connect with your audience.</p>
<h3 id="travel-and-adventure">Travel and Adventure</h3>
<p>Iconic landmarks, cityscapes, and adventure-themed designs appeal to travel enthusiasts. You can create beautiful illustrations or typography-based designs celebrating different locations and activities. Incorporate personal travel experiences or popular travel destinations to make your designs more relatable.</p>
<h3 id="gaming-and-technology">Gaming and Technology</h3>
<p>With the gaming industry booming, designs featuring gaming culture, tech humor, and coding jokes are in high demand. Just be sure to create original content rather than using existing game characters or logos. Consider staying updated with the latest gaming trends and releases to keep your designs relevant.</p>
<h3 id="art-and-aesthetics">Art and Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Abstract art, geometric designs, and hand-drawn illustrations can make for eye-catching merchandise products. This category allows for a lot of creative freedom and originality. Collaborate with emerging artists to bring fresh and unique designs to your store, which can also help in cross-promotion.</p>
<h3 id="animals-and-pets">Animals and Pets</h3>
<p>Cute and funny animal designs, as well as pet-themed designs, are perennially popular. Original illustrations of animals or pets can attract pet owners and animal lovers. Engage with pet communities on social media to understand their preferences and create designs that resonate with them.</p>
<h3 id="inspirational-and-motivational-quotes">Inspirational and Motivational Quotes</h3>
<p>Positive affirmations and motivational quotes can inspire your customers. Since these are generally short phrases, it's easier to create unique content without copyright concerns. Personalize these quotes by adding creative typography or pairing them with unique illustrations.</p>
<h3 id="holiday-and-seasonal-themes">Holiday and Seasonal Themes</h3>
<p>Seasonal designs for holidays like Christmas, Halloween, and Valentine's Day can lead to spikes in sales. Create festive and unique designs that capture the spirit of these celebrations. Planning ahead and releasing your designs well before the holidays can help you capitalize on the seasonal market.</p>
<h3 id="customizable-designs">Customizable Designs</h3>
<p>Offering customizable products for special occasions like family reunions, weddings, or group events can be a big hit. Personalized designs make great gifts and are often treasured keepsakes. Provide easy-to-use customization tools on your website to attract customers looking for personalized merchandise.</p>
<h3 id="music-and-bands">Music and Bands</h3>
<p>Music fans love wearing their favorite bands and lyrics. Remember, though, that band logos and lyrics are usually protected by copyright, so you must obtain permission or create tributes that don't infringe on these rights. Consider creating designs that capture the essence of a music genre or era rather than specific bands to avoid legal issues.</p>
<h3 id="educational-and-geeky-themes">Educational and Geeky Themes</h3>
<p>Science, math, and history-themed designs cater to niche markets and can be both educational and fun. These designs can be great conversation starters and appeal to "geek chic" enthusiasts. Partner with educators or influencers in these fields to create content that is both accurate and appealing.</p>
