            <div id="num-0xDEADBEEF">
                <strong>0xDEADBEEF</strong>
                <p>0xDEADBEEF ("dead beef") is frequently used to indicate a software crash or deadlock in embedded systems. DEADBEEF was originally used to mark newly allocated areas of memory that had not yet been initialized—when scanning a memory dump, it is easy to see the DEADBEEF. It is used by IBM RS/6000 systems, Mac OS on 32-bit PowerPC processors and the Commodore Amiga as a magic debug value. On Sun Microsystems' Solaris, it marks freed kernel memory. On OpenVMS running on Alpha processors, DEAD_BEEF can be seen by pressing CTRL-T. The DEC Alpha SRM console has a background process that traps memory errors, identified by PS as "BeefEater waiting on 0xdeadbeef". </p>
            </div>

                <p>0xDEADDEAD ("dead dead") is the bug check (STOP) code displayed when invoking a Blue Screen of Death either by telling the kernel via the attached debugger, or by using a special keystroke combination. This is usually seen by driver developers, as it is used to get a memory dump on Windows NT based systems. An alternative to 0xDEADDEAD is the bug check code 0x000000E2, as they are both called MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH as seen on the Microsoft Developer Network.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="num-0xDEADD00D">

<p>Computer programmers have a special sense of humor that is often manifested in source code. One example of this kind of humor are magic numbers that can be read as hexspeak words like the ones above. Magic numbers like these are often used as debug values in computer processors and operating systems.</p>
<p>Information on these magic numbers is from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak">Wikipedia article about Hexspeak</a>.</p>
